# Portfolio

This site is my first shot at making a portolio webpage.

It compiles the projects I made, the certificates I received from completing online courses, and some information about my learning of coding.

The portfolio itself is based on a [project from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) with specific user stories.
